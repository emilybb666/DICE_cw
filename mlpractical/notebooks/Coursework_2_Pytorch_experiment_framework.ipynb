    "# Coursework 2 - PyTorch based experiment framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "Welcome to the coursework 2 PyTorch experiment framework. Pytorch is a  modern, intuitive, highly Pythonic and very fast framework for building differentiable graphs. Neural networks, as it happens, are a type of acyclic differentiable graph, so PyTorch is a great framework to use, if you want to build  complicated deep networks fairly easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLP package vs Pytorch\n",
    "**Student**: So, why do I have to learn to use PyTorch now? I've spent all this time working on the MLP framework. Was that a waste of time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: Well, Pytorch is everything the MLP package is, but faster, cleaner and far more resourceful. Since it is one of the main deep learning frameworks being used by industry and research alike, it has been fine-tuned quite a bit, to conform to the expectation of researchers and engineers alike. What this means, is that PyTorch is now a very robust and highly flexible package, that you can use for any project you want to work on in the future, if it involves trainining differentiable graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, MLP is written in NumPy and your time working on it has taught some low level details of NNs; PyTorch was written to look as much as possible to NumPy, so it will feel very familiar to you. The skills you have acquired are highly transferable (that is, they generalize well, so not much overfitting there...). \n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch will almost always have all the latest and greatest implemented in it as soon as they are released as papers, and if not, give it a week or two and someone will reproduce it. If you can't wait, you can reproduce it yourself and open source it. A great way to show your skills and get github likes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition PyTorch has Autograd! Automatic differentiation (previously mentioned in [lectures](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2018-19/mlp05-learn.pdf)). \"What is this?\" you may ask. Remember having to write all those backprop functions? Forget about it. Automatic differentiation allows you to backprop through any PyTorch operation you have used in your graph, by simply calling backward(). This [blog-post](https://jdhao.github.io/2017/11/12/pytorch-computation-graph/) explains how Pytorch's autograd works at an intuitive level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student**: Why did we even have to use the MLP package? We did we even bother if such awesome frameworks are available?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: The purpose of the MLP package was not to allow you to build fast deep learning systems. Instead, it was to help teach you the low level mechanics and sensitivities of building a deep learning system. It allowed you to delve deep into how one can go about building a deep learning framework from scratch. The intuitions you have gained from going through your assignments and courseworks allow you to see deeper in what makes or breaks a deep learning system, at a level few people actually have. You are no longer restricted to the higher level modules provided by Pytorch/TensorFlow. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, for example, a new project required you to build something that does not exist in PyTorch/TensorFlow, or otherwise modify existing modules in a way that requires understanding and intuitions on backpropagation and layer/optimizer/component implementation, you would be able to do it much more easily than others who did not. You are now equipped to understand differentiable graphs, the chain rule, numerical errors, debugging at the lowest level and deep learning system architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, by trying to implement your modules in an efficient way, you have also become aware of how to optimize a system for efficiency, and gave you intuitions on how one could further improve such a system (parallelization of implementations). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the slowness of CPU training has allowed you to understand just how important modern GPU acceleration is, for deep learning research and applications. By coming across a large breadth of problems and understanding their origins, you will now be able to both anticipate and solve future problems in a more comprehensive way than someone who did not go through the trouble of implementing the basics from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Student**: If we are switching to Pytorch, then why bother implementing convolutions in the MLP package for the coursework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: All your instructors, myself included, have found it greatly beneficial to implement convolutional networks from scratch. Once you implement convolutional layers, you will have a much deeper insight and understanding into how and why they work... as well as how they break. This way, you know what to do and what to avoid in the future. You might even be able to come with the next great network type yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student**: So, how is the learning curve of Pytorch? How do I start?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: You can start by using this notebook on your experiments, it should teach you quite a lot on how to properly use PyTorch for basic conv net training. You should be aware of the [official pytorch github](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), the [pytorch official documentation page](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) and the [pytorch tutorials page](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past year, nearly all students using PyTorch and Tensorflow on MLP and on projects found it easier and faster to get up to speed with PyTorch. In fact, I was a TensorFlow user myself, and learning TensorFlow was much more challenging than PyTorch. Mainly because TensorFlow has its own way of 'thinking' about how you build a graph and execute operations - whereas PyTorch is dynamic and works like NumPy, hence is more intuitive. If you were able to work well with the MLP package, you'll be up and running in no time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Student**: OK, so how fast is pytorch compared to MLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: On the CPU side of things, you'll find pytorch at least 5x faster than the MLP framework (about equal for fully connected networks, but much faster for more complicated things like convolutions - unless you write extremely efficient convolutional layer code), and if you choose to use GPUs, either using MS Azure, Google Cloud or our very own MLP Cluster (available for next semester), you can expect, depending on implementation and hardware an approximate 25-70x speed ups, compared to the CPU performance of pytorch. Yes, that means an experiment that would run overnight, now would only require about 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student**: Ahh, where should I go to ask more questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TA**: As always, start with a Google/DuckDuckGo search, then have a look at the PyTorch Github and PyTorch docs, and if you can't find the answer come to Piazza and the lab sessions. We will be there to support you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: The code in this jupyter notebook is to introduce you to pytorch and allow you to play around with it in an interactive manner. However, to run your experiments, you should use the Pytorch experiment framework located in ```mlp/pytorch_experiment_scripts```. Instructions on how to use it can be found in ```notes/pytorch-experiment-framework.md``` along with the comments and documentation included in the code itself."
